### Perfect Pumpkin Pie by John Kanell

#### Ingredients:
- Favorite pie dough or pre-made crust
- 160 grams (3/4 cup) packed brown sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/8 teaspoon cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (freshly grated recommended)
- 3 room temperature eggs
- 12-ounce can of evaporated milk (or cream for a richer version)
- Optional: allspice or cardamom, 1/4 teaspoon each
- Pie weights or dried beans for blind baking
- Egg wash (optional): 1 egg mixed with 1 tablespoon of milk, cream, or water

#### Equipment:
- Pie dish
- Pastry mat (optional)
- Oven
- Whisk
- Mixing bowls

#### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Pie Crust**:
   - **[0:07:30]** Start by rolling out your pie dough on a floured surface to about 1/4" thickness. If using a pre-made crust, skip to step 4.
   - **[1:03:57]** Transfer the rolled dough into your pie dish. Trim the excess dough, leaving about 1 inch hanging over the edges.
   - **[1:22:45]** Fold the excess dough underneath itself to create a thick, clean edge. Crimp the edge as desired.
   - **[1:42:54]** Place the pie crust in the freezer for at least 20 minutes to firm up.

2. **Blind Baking the Crust**:
   - **[2:00:12]** Preheat your oven to 425°F (400°F if using a pre-made crust). Line the chilled pie crust with parchment paper cut into a circle and fill with pie weights or dried beans.
   - **[2:46:53]** Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Remove the weights and parchment paper afterwards.

3. **Prepare the Pumpkin Filling**:
   - **[2:57:72]** In a large bowl, combine brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg. Whisk thoroughly to mix.
   - **[4:03:60]** Add the pumpkin puree and mix well. Then, incorporate the eggs one at a time, followed by the evaporated milk, mixing until smooth.
   - **[7:05:81]** Optionally, warm the filling in a pot over medium-low heat until it is warm to the touch, stirring occasionally. This step helps to reduce baking time and improve texture.

4. **Assemble and Bake**:
   - **[7:55:41]** Pour the warm filling into the pre-baked pie shell. If using a pre-made crust, note that it may yield enough filling for two pies.
   - **[8:44:07]** Bake at 400°F for 15 minutes, then reduce the temperature to 350°F and continue baking for about 40 minutes or until the center just jiggles softly.

5. **Cool and Serve**:
   - Allow the pie to cool completely before cutting into it. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream for added deliciousness.

John's video tutorial offers further visuals and tips, and he emphasizes the choice between using homemade or pre-made crusts, as well as the optional step of warming the filling before baking. This can help reduce baking time and prevent the pie surface from cracking.

### Perfect Pumpkin Pie by John Kanell

**Preparing the Pie Crust**
1. **Make or Prepare Crust** (00:07 - 00:17): Start with your crust. If using homemade pie dough, roll it out to about 1/4 inch thick for a buttery crisp crust. If using a pre-made crust, adapt the steps accordingly.
2. **Preheat Oven** (00:56): Preheat your oven to 425°F (for homemade crust) or 400°F (for pre-made crust).
3. **Shape and Chill Crust** (01:03 - 01:42): Transfer your rolled-out crust into a pie dish, trim the excess dough leaving about 1 inch around the edges, fold the edges under, and crimp as desired. Chill the crust in the freezer for at least 20 minutes.
4. **Blind Bake** (02:46 - 02:50): Line the chilled crust with parchment paper and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake in the preheated oven at 425°F for about 15 minutes.

**Making the Filling**
5. **Mix Dry Ingredients** (03:00 - 04:00): In a bowl, combine 160 grams of brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/8 teaspoon cloves, and 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg. Whisk to remove any lumps.
6. **Add Wet Ingredients** (04:03 - 05:51): To the dry ingredients, add 3 room temperature eggs and one 12-ounce can of evaporated milk. Mix until smooth. If desired, gently warm this mixture over low heat while stirring to remove air bubbles.

**Assembling and Baking the Pie**
7. **Prepare for Final Baking** (07:25 - 08:30): Remove the pie crust from the oven after blind baking. Optional: Apply an egg wash for a golden finish.
8. **Add Filling to Crust** (08:30 - 08:34): Pour the warm pumpkin filling into the crust. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F.
9. **Bake** (08:46 - 08:50): Bake the pie at 350°F until the center jiggles softly, about 40 minutes. If the crust edges brown too quickly, tent with foil.

**Cooling and Serving**
10. **Cool and Serve** (09:20 - 09:44): Allow the pie to cool down completely to set the filling. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream and enjoy!

This recipe highlights the traditional steps John Kanell uses, with options for both homemade and store-bought crusts, ensuring a delicious pumpkin pie perfect for any fall gathering.

- 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1/8 teaspoon cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
- 3 room temperature eggs
- 12 ounces canned evaporated milk
- 1 can pumpkin puree (or homemade puree)
- Optional: additional spices like allspice or cardamom

### Equipment:
- Pie dish
- Oven
- Mixing bowl
- Whisk
- Parchment paper
- Pie weights or dried beans
- Pot (if warming filling)

### Instructions:
1. **Prepare Pie Crust** (Timestamps reflect video time)
   - **[00:07:30]** If using homemade crust, roll it to about 1/4" thickness. For a pre-made crust, adjust oven settings as needed.
   - **[01:03:57]** Transfer the crust into a pie dish. Trim the excess dough leaving about 1" around, then fold under to create a thick edge.
   - **[01:35:55]** Crimp the edges as desired. Freeze the crust for at least 20 minutes.
   - **[02:02:15]** Line the chilled crust with parchment paper and fill with pie weights. Blind bake at 425°F (218°C) for 15 minutes.

2. **Prepare Filling**
   - **[02:57:72]** In a mixing bowl, combine brown sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg.
   - **[04:00:87]** Add eggs and evaporated milk to the spice mixture. Whisk until smooth.
   - **[04:03:87]** Stir in the pumpkin puree until all ingredients are well combined.
   - **[07:14:52]** Optional: Warm the filling on the stove over medium-low heat until it is warm to the touch (not boiling).

3. **Assemble and Bake**
   - **[07:38:56]** Remove the pie weights and parchment from the crust. Optional: apply an egg wash for a golden finish.
   - **[08:25:41]** Pour the filling into the crust. If the filling was warmed, pour it directly; if not, it might need a longer baking time.
   - **[08:40:62]** Bake at 400°F (204°C) for 15 minutes, then reduce temperature to 350°F (177°C) and bake until the center jiggles slightly but is set, about 40 minutes.

4. **Cool and Serve**
   - **[09:20:49]** Allow the pie to cool completely before serving. This lets the custard set properly and makes slicing easier.

5. **Optional Tips**
   - **[09:08:83]** If the pie crust edges brown too quickly, tent them with foil halfway through baking.
   - **[09:26:76]** Experiment with warming the filling before baking to reduce baking time and potentially enhance texture.

Enjoy your homemade pumpkin pie, perfect for any fall celebration or a comforting treat at home.
